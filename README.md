# Technology used 
- react native 
- react native maps

# Execution 
- expo loaction was used to get the users location after permission was granted 
- react native maps alog with google as a provider was used to track a users locatiion by every 2 meters (this was used due to physical contraints but can be increased )


# Running 
- assuming node (v20) is installed, run npm install 
- assuming expo mobile app is install on mobile device, scan qr code which appears after running npm start 
- press start and walk around to watch  the tracking occur, stop to pause tracking, reset to restart and save to simulate sending to a server
