# Location Tracking 


# Technology used 
- react native 
- react native maps 
- google maps (provider)
- expo location 

# Execution 
- expo location was used to get the users location after permission was granted 
- react native maps along with google as a provider was used to track a users location by every 2 meters (this was used due to physical contraints but can be increased )


# Running 
- assuming node (v20) is installed, run npm install 
- assuming expo mobile app is installed on mobile device, scan qr code which appears after running npm start 
- press start and walk around to watch  the tracking occur, stop to pause tracking, reset to restart and save to simulate sending to a server 


# Obstacles 
- only obstacle faced was acquiring a google maps api key to allow tracking without a simulator
